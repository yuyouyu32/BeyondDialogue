The scene involves a tense yet respectful interaction between Snape and Thaddeus, emphasizing mutual respect for each other's expertise in potion-making. This setting largely defines the emotions Snape might exhibit.\n\nHappiness is likely minimal due to the overall gloomy and strict atmosphere of the interaction. Sadness is not particularly prominent either, as Snape's demeanor remains more stern and reflective of professional engagement rather than melancholic emotions. Disgust could be present but muted, as Snape may perceive Thaddeus’s ruthless methods as not overly distasteful but merely different from his own.\n\nFear and surprise are both relatively low, given Snape's often stoic and reserved nature. Anger, however, could be more pronounced, stemming from the intense concentration and potentially competitive undercurrent of the interaction.

Snape is likely to experience anger due to his mean and strict persona and a high level of displeasure for Morgana's cryptic prophecy. Fear can be present due to the unsettling nature of the prediction regarding his fate. Disgust could be seen as he disdainfully perceives the prediction and possibly Morgana’s demeanor. Given the gloomy and devoted aspect of his personality, sadness may be subtly present as well, reflecting the gravity of the situation. Surprise is also a plausible emotion as he contemplates the unexpected celestial insights. However, happiness is least likely given his general disposition and the foreboding situation.\n\nHence, the scores for each emotion would be:\n\n- **Happiness**: Very low, almost negligible, fitting his dark demeanor and the somber context.\n- **Sadness**: Moderately present due to the gloomy nature and seriousness of the fate prediction.\n- **Disgust**: High, reflecting his cold and disdainful nature amid the circumstances.\n- **Fear**: Moderately high, since the fate prediction could worry him despite his usual inscrutability.\n- **Surprise**: Present but not overwhelming, stemming from Morgana's cryptic message.\n- **Anger**: High, inspired by his mean-spirited and strict disposition towards unwelcome revelations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final emotional scores for Snape in this scene are:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"happiness\": 0,\n    \"sadness\": 6,\n    \"disgust\": 8,\n    \"fear\": 7,\n    \"surprise\": 5,\n    \"anger\": 8\n}\n```",

Sadness is also minor, as it's not particularly evoked by the situation. Disgust may be slightly evident, considering Snape's disdain for the cursed vault and possibly for Reginald's dark humor. Fear is moderately present due to the inherent danger of the environment. Surprise is low, as Snape's demeanor is typically controlled and composed. Anger, though subtly woven through his stern demeanor, peaks slightly higher due to the stress and perhaps irritation with the curses or Reginald's character.\n\nHere are the detailed scores:\n\n- **Happiness**: Very low, given the context and Snape's personality.\n- **Sadness**: Low, as the scene doesn't evoke this emotion strongly for him.\n- **Disgust**: Moderate, due to the cursed environment and perhaps interpersonal dynamics.\n- **Fear**: Moderate, given the dangerous setting.\n- **Surprise**: Low, Snape rarely shows surprise openly.\n- **Anger**: Moderate, influenced by the challenging situation and potentially Reginald's demeanor.\n\nFinal emotion scores in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"happiness\": 1,\n  \"sadness\": 2,\n  \"disgust\": 5,\n  \"fear\": 6,\n  \"surprise\": 2,\n  \"anger\": 5\n}\n```",
